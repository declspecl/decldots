Decldots is deterministic, declarative way to manage your dotfiles on Unix systems.
Love Nix home-manager for its declarative syntax and dynamic nature, but hate its immutable nature and quirks?
Decldots aims to fill that niche by providing a managed framework for configuring your dotfiles.

Written in 100% strictly typed Ruby, Decldots is a safe and reliable way to manage your dotfiles.
