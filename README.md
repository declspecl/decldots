# Rbdots

Rbdots is deterministic, declarative way to manage your dotfiles on Unix systems.
Love Nix for its declarative syntax and dynamic nature, but hate its immutable nature and quirks?
Rbdots aims to fill that niche by providing a managed framework for configuring your dotfiles.
It features a concise Ruby DSL as the interface for dotfile management.
